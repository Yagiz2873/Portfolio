# *Portfolio*
*Welcome to my Portfolio Website. In this website, you can find some information about me such as my studies and my contact information.*
# *Summary*
*As you can see in the design, I have divided this webpage into 3 basic areas. The first one is "Homepage". It includes basic and summary information about me. The second area is "About" area. This area includes some information about my university life, my internships and my interests in software field. The final area is "My Studies." In this area, you can see some of my studies' pictures about Frontend Development. In this area, I have added one link each picture so if you press the pictures with mouse you can go to each of my studies and view them. Also, all areas have the header part that includes my name and areas' links and footer part that includes my contact information.*
